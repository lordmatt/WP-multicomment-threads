# WP-multicomment-threads
A plugin to allow multiple comment threads on the one page

The idea is to enable a side-by-side debate with other pages/posts hold the comments 
for each side and some way to display the comments from each of the daughter posts.

This first draft was written by ChatGPT when I asked it to help me find a plugin.

I'm 99% sure there is no plugin that does this.

I'd like to make this a lot more user-friendly and support the block editor. But
I have never coded a block thing before - the JavaScript part is a bit off-putting.

This project was first written about [on my blog](https://lordmatt.co.uk/technology/coding-and-development/code-review-with-me-wp-multicomment-threads/). I'll track our progress with further updates there.
